         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">Humbly preſented and ſubmitted unto your moſt judicious conſiderations, wherein are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated ſundry ways to raiſe Money, both speedily, for the preſent neceſſities of the Kingdom, and certainly, for a laſting Annuall Revenue: Whereby the induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious People of this Nation may be eaſed, his Majeſty truly and faithfully ſerved, generall Taxes for the future leſsned, Pole-Mony and Donatives spared; and the Government under his Majeſty's moſt Royall Perſon (which God grant in mercy to this Nation may be for many years over us) ſplendidly and magnificently main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and ſupported.</head>
            <p>IN order to which, by way of Introduction, Hiſtory doth make it out, that it was held as a Maxim amongſt the wiſeſt Counſellors of State, and greateſt Politicians, to be ever the ſafeſt, beſt, and moſt pleaſing way to any civilized People, to raiſe the Revenue for the ſupport of the Government, out of thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:172738:2"/>that although they are at never ſo great a charge to pleaſe their fancies and appetites they will not reſtrain themſelvs, counting it Gallantry to purchaſe their pleaſures at dear rates, glorying in the profuſeneſs of expence therein.</p>
            <p>Therefore, how much better is it (ſeeing Vice is ſo hard to be exploded from Man-kind,) that out of it a Revenue, for the expence and ſupport of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould be raiſed, rather than out of the Induſtry of laborious and ingenious men.</p>
            <p>And to ſatisfy all Perſons concerned herein, that it is no new thing to have Money raiſed out of the vices of a Nation for the ſupport of the Government, but that it is practiſed among very knowing and politick People: <hi>Ruſſia, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us fit examples, as at this day is practiſed amongſt them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> The Emperour of thoſe large Territories receiveth his greateſt Incom out of his <hi>Cabacks,</hi> which in our Language is either Tipling-Houſes, Drinking-ſchools, or Ale-houſes, either of which that word will bear.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Italy,</hi> As <hi>Rome, Naples,</hi> and other parts, the Princes of which Territories do raiſe great Revenues from their licenced Stews; though I think it very unfit, that among us who profeſs the purity of the Goſpel ſuch-wickedneſs ſhould be countenanced or tolerated upon any ſuch Accompt as to raiſe Mony in this Nation thereby.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe great Monarch, for Tobacco vended in ſmoak and ſneezing as alſo out of Play-houſes, and other Recreations permitted in his Kingdom, receives yearly a very conſiderable Incomb.</p>
            <p>So that you ſee the fore-mentioned Nations, through a diſcreet Policy have laid their greateſt burdens upon Vice meerly to ſpare the virtuous.</p>
            <p>Are we in <hi>England</hi> ſo free from Vice, that we cannot find whereon to lay the like Impoſitions, but that moſt of all Taxes generally muſt be laid upon the Induſtrious party? Surely no, for although <hi>England</hi> is fuller of vertuous perſons then any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the World, yet it is conceived by Juditious men, there is ſo much vice nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed among us, that if what is practiſed, were loaden with pecuniary dutys, will raiſe a very conſiderable Reuenue towards the expence of the Government, and thereby greatly eaſe and encourage Ingenuous and vertuous men. Which, that it may be ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Annuall Rent.</note> which computed at 3 l. Fine one with the other,<note place="margin">Ready Money.</note> and as much yearly rent, amounts unto three hundred thouſand pounds preſent money,<note place="margin">l. 300000</note> and the like yearly.<note place="margin">l. 300000</note> For though in ſome places 20 s. may be enough, in others ten and 20 l. would be but little enough.</p>
            <p>The Retaylers of drink being thus eſtabliſhed, and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Revenue raiſed upon them, then may the Exciſe which the Brewers now pay, and is ſo ſtumbled at, (becauſe not any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that brews their own Beer, doth pay one farthing to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe) be totally laid aſide, and likewiſe that deſign of raiſing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe on Malſters, for thoſe that make their own Malt, will have the like priviledg as when they brewed their own Beer: For as the Exciſe is now gathered, only the poor and ſuch as have their drink from Brewers, and ſet out Ships, bear the whole burden thereof. And ſuch as are able, and brew their own Drink; of which thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Families there be in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> that do ſo, go ſcotfree.</p>
            <p>But becauſe it may be alledged; It is not equall that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taylers of Beer and Ale, ſhould only be charged with a duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſupport of the Government, ſeeing all in the Nation reap alike benefit, and ought to bear their proportion; before I end, you ſhall ſee every one, by one way or other, be they Rich, or be they Poor, will be brought in for a ſhare, that it ſhall not lye altogether upon particular ſhoulders.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That none be permitted without Licence to Retail Tobacco, which ſuperfluous ſmoky Weed, is ſo viciouſly uſed in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> that there is no one thing vended in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which can bear a greater Fine and yearly Revenue then it; eſpecially if the exceſſive and exorbitant gains which the Retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers obtain thereon, be in any reaſonable meaſure conſidered; for that which the Ware-houſe-man, and Retailing Tobacconiſt buyes of the Merchant, reckoned <hi>Verginia,</hi> ordinary ſort, at 5 d. and 6 d. <hi>per</hi> pound, he utters again for 18 d. and 2 s. <hi>per</hi> pound, and what they buy of that which they call, ſweet ſcented <hi>Verginia</hi> of the Merchant for 10 d. and 12 d. <hi>per</hi> pound, they utter again at 3 s. and 4 s. <hi>per</hi> pound, nay, oftentimes they have as much for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſort, as for the ſweet ſcented. And when the Retailing Tobacconiſts vend theſe ſorts to Vintners, Ale-houſes, and Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and who utter it by the Pipe, they ſell it for ſix and 8 s. <hi>per</hi> pound; and for the better ſort by the Pipe, obtain 12 s. and 16 s. <hi>per</hi> pound: which conſidered, is there any thing that merits more to have a duty raiſed thereon, then this Weed Tobacco? For if dear or cheap, none uſes it the leſs, or will do ſo, that Calculating the multitude of Warehouſe-men, &amp; Tobacco-ſhops, retailing To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, and then thoſe that uſe it in Chandlers and Cooks ſhops,

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:172738:3"/>fore to be helpful in their ſtation to bear a part of the Nations Charge, there can be no way ſo convenient to raiſe a duty from ſuch, but to Enact it, That no perſon ſhall keep a Coach in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> or <hi>Wales</hi> without Licenſe, for which to pay five pound Fine, and five pound Annual Rent for a Coach of two Horſes, and of four, 7 l. 10 s. and of ſix, ten pounds; and ſo <hi>pro Rato</hi> for one two, or more Coaches that they may keep, of two, four, or ſix Horſes, be they Nobility, Gentry, Citizens, Stage, or Hackney-Coaches, it being ſuppoſed, that throughout <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> there may be uſed twenty thouſand Coaches when leaſt; which at five pounds Fine, and five pounds Annual Rent, will amount unto one hundred thouſand pounds ready money, and as much An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.<note place="margin">l. 100000</note> And what perſon is he that for his Eaſe, Vanity,<note place="margin">10000</note> or Pride, will refrain the keeping of a Coach for 5 l.

            <p>So that it will appear, by the ſix foregoing propoſals, there may eaſily be raiſed for the preſent neceſſities of the Kingdome,<note place="margin">l. 790000</note> ſeven hundred and ninety thouſand pounds ready money,<note place="margin">79000</note> and as much Annual Rent, which will go very far towards the expenſes of the Government, and the taking away of Taxes, which can never be levi'd to raiſe mony ſo equally and conveniently, or ſo much to the eaſe and content of the People, as by ſuch wayes as theſe; which if drawn into a right Channel, and the collecting of this money which will yearly be paid in upon Licenſed Ale-houſes, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taylors of Tobacco, beſetled upon the preſent Receivers through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> it will be done at a very eaſy Charge: And then the Auditors keeping the Accompts, as they do of his Majeſties other Rents in each County, will be a means that no Arrears be ſuffered, or uncollected, to the great ſatisfaction of thoſe Towns and Pariſhes in each County that are to pay the ſame.</p>
            <p>In a Book called, <hi>Trade Revived,</hi> publiſhed about a year ſince, as will appear, in fol. 49. of that book, and ſo forwards, the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of raiſing money by Licenſes upon Beer and Ale, Tobacco, and other Liquors, was ſet forth; and beſides theſe, other fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Propoſals of raiſing money upon Coaches, and Paſtimes, in this Paper inſerted, there be ſundry other wayes propounded for the like uſe, as well for a preſent ſupply, as an Annual Rent; which if taken into conſideration with the reſt, happily may be of good uſe and furniſh mens to do what ever work is to be done in this Kingdome, without trouble or vexation to the people, but rather to their quiet and advantage.

I conceive it may be acceptable enough, briefly in reference to this our purpoſe, once more to bring in view, what was therein ſet down touching theſe things, which are as followeth.</p>
            <list>

               <item>Fourthly, That publick Brokers may be eſtabliſhed for the uſe of the Commerce, and none elſe admitted to uſe that Calling, and at their admiſſion to pay a Fine and yearly Rent.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The uſe of which four-recited particulars, (both as to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Nation in general, &amp; every particular perſon) is at large in the ſaid ſheets of <hi>Trade Revived,</hi> and fol. 49. before mentioned, ſet forth, being purpoſely for brevity ſake here omitted. And when the benefit and advantage which the Nation will receive by the aforeſaid ſettlement is taken into conſideration, as alſo calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of the preſent advance of money thereby, and future Rent that will come in there-from, ſurely it will apparently be cleared to all, that a moſt plentiful increaſe will be had thereof, both preſent and to come, much to eaſe the people from Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which let them be never ſo ſmall, are both burdenſome, and ill reſcented; all which together, may ariſe unto as much as the ſix firſt Propoſals.</p>
